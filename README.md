# customer_churn_predoction
This project was built to develop a Customer Churn Prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model classifies customer into churners (Customers likely to leave) and non-churners (those likely to stay). 
The scope of this project includes:

Data Collection & Analysis: Gathering customer data, including demographics, usage patterns, billing history, and customer support interactions.

Feature Engineering: Identifying key factors contributing to churn, such as call drop rates, billing issues, or lack of engagement.

Model Development: Implementing machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to classify customers.

Evaluation & Deployment: Measuring model accuracy and integrating it into the companyâ€™s customer management system for real-time predictions.
